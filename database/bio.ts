export const DEFAULT_BIO = `Hi, I'm Dzuhan. Based in East Java, I am a Graphic Designer who loves mixing traditional design principles with modern tech. Over the past two years, I’ve worked with various brands to sharpen their visual identity, from social media marketing at Aida Creatives to product photography and layout design.

My approach is highly systematic. I don’t just design; I organize. When leading a creative team for an organization project, I proved this by building SOPs and Notion systems that tripled our department's revenue. I bring this same level of structured thinking to every project I touch.

Right now, I’m exploring the future of design by developing web tools for creatives using AI Studio.`;
